## üõ°Ô∏è The Problem: The "Vibe Coding" Security Crisis

Modern development prioritizes speed. While this accelerates innovation, it often leaves critical security gaps:
*   **Rapid Development:** Fast-paced coding introduces vulnerabilities that are missed by traditional tools.
*   **AI-Assisted Coding without Oversight:** Tools like GitHub Copilot are fantastic for productivity but can generate insecure code.
*   **Lack of Security Expertise:** Developers are expected to be security experts, which is an unrealistic burden.
*   **False Positives:** Traditional security scanners flood developers with irrelevant warnings, leading to alert fatigue.

## ‚ú® The Solution: KavachAI - Cursor for Cybersecurity

KavachAI is not just another linter. It's a comprehensive security platform that understands your code. By integrating Gemini AI, we provide a **"Cursor for Cybersecurity"**‚Äîan intelligent assistant that makes security an intuitive part of your development process.

**Key Features:**
*   **üß† AI-Powered Analysis:** Goes beyond simple pattern matching to understand code context and logic, powered by Gemini.
*   **üéØ False Positive Reduction:** Our AI validation layer critically reviews findings to eliminate noise and only report real threats.
*   **üí° Intelligent Code Fixes:** Get meaningful, context-aware code suggestions that fix the root cause of vulnerabilities.
*   **üåê Multi-Platform Security:** Secure your entire technology stack: web applications, smart contracts, wallets, and your local code editor.
*   **üîí Secure by Default:** Seamlessly integrates into your workflow, making security the default, not an afterthought.
